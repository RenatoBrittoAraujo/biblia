# The Rosary of the Holy Catholic Church

## Origin

The Rosary has power. It is the most important prayer for a layman. It arose from monks, who prayed all 150 psalms at once. For the illiterate, a prayer of the monks was adapted but praying 150 Hail Marys.

## Instructions

- Read the [structure of the rosary] (#structure-of-the-rosary) to understand how to organize the prayer.
- Read [the mysteries] (#mysteries) to understand what should be contemplated during prayer.

1 Rosary is the combination of 4 thirds prayed in sequence. Before praying, one must choose whether to pray the rosary or the rosary.

The Rosary is to be prayed whole without pauses. Reverence in the Rosary is important, not eating words or speeding up the prayer. Praying on your knees also works as a penalty to be offered. You can pray in silence or you can pray out loud.

The idea is not to focus on the words during the 10 Hail Marys, but to contemplate the mystery in your thoughts as you vocalize the prayer.
